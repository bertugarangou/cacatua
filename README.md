## Cacatua is a hardware music machine
Which makes music from hard drives, dvd/cd drivers and other kinds of drivers. It prefers old devices, which make more noise so it can be magic-software-digita-eggcellence-converted into nais music!

It can (will be, not yes) usable for everyone with at least one hardware noisy drive/part but adjustments in the code to fine tune the notes will be needed (an app for tunning and Arduino(c) IDE is essencially all you need, nothing more).

### !!! ATTENTION !!!
All the code, files, folders and everything will be changed and updated while in developing.
